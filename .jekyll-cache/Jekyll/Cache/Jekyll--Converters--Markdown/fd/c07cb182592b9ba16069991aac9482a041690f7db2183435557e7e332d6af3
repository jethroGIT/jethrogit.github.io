<p>There are a few optimization algorithms which are faster than <em>gradient descent</em>. In order to understand these optimization algorithms, we need to understand the concept of <strong>exponentially weighted moving averages</strong>.</p>

<p>Suppose that the temperature of day $i$ is denoted by $\theta_i$ from $i=1, \ldots, 365$. Visually the temperatures are shown in the image above. Concretely, we show several examples of the temperatures as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}
	\theta_1 &= 40^{\circ} \text{F} \\
	\theta_2 &= 49^{\circ} \text{F} \\
	\theta_3 &= 40^{\circ} \text{F} \\	
	         &\vdots \\
	\theta_{180} &= 60^{\circ} \text{F} \\		         
	\theta_{181} &= 56^{\circ} \text{F} \\		      
			&\vdots
\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>As we can see in the image above, the values of temperatures during a year are <em>noisy</em> which means that there is considerable variation in the values. The variation is caused by <em>noise</em> and <em>we need to remove the variation</em> if we want to expose the underlying values of temperatures (Brownlee, 2019).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do remove the noise which resides in the values of time series?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the techniques to remove the noise is called <strong>smoothing</strong>. The common technique used commonly in time series forecasting is <strong>exponentially moving averages</strong>. Computing <strong>exponentially moving averages</strong> involves constructing a new series whose values are calculated by the average of raw observations in the original time series. Let’s denote the new series as $v_t$ for $t=1, 2, \ldots, 365$ as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}
 		v_t = \beta v_{t-1} + (1-\beta) \theta_t \tag{1}\label{eq:gamma-theta}. 
	\end{equation}</script>

<p>with $v_t$ is the average at time $t$, $\theta_t$ is the temperature at time $t$, and $\beta$ is the parameter determining <em>average number of days’ temperatures</em>. Specifically, $v_t$ is approximately <strong>average over</strong> $\frac{1}{1-\beta}$ days’ temperature.</p>

<p>We have completed our <strong>backpropagation algorithm</strong>.  <br />
Finally we can update our weight matrices as follows:<br />
